Q.7  Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the site, as this is not typically possible for a normal user.

Answer :    
           select u.id as user_id,
                 u.username,
                 count(*) as total_likes_by_a_user
                 from users as u 
                 join likes
                 on u.id = likes.user_id
                 group by u.id
                 having total_likes_by_a_user = (
                 select count(*) from photos);
